            <p>If you've found this website, you must have first visited my portfolio site! While my current
                line of work has me creating websites and apps, writing software and designing logos, there has
                always been another dream in the back of my head. There has always been a desire for something
                more. <br> This website... is more.</p>

            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <h3>A Little Helpful History</h3>
            <p>It's true. Like most kids, I could often be seen in my youth tumbling over
            cardboard boxes in my backyard, pretending to fly my spacship from planet to
            planet, saving mankind from eminent destruction. In my world, the sky was
                definitely NOT the limit. When I grew up, and began preparations
            for my collegiate career, family and freinds began to barrade me with questions
            of my plans and aspirations. <br><br> I asked them, "Why? Do you think I've changed?"
            <br><br>In middle and high school, I went out of my way to take every engineering, math, and physics
            course there was to take. I joined robotics clubs, science olympiad, the mathletes, and even
            took a few college level courses when I had the time. I just couldn't get enough of it.
            Now, three years deep in my Software Engineering degree, I'm still striving. <br> Recently,
            I've been studying Machine Learning with Professor Shaoen Wu at Ball State to understand
            computers and robotics even more, and working part time at a company to help build websites and
            apps for local businesses.<br><br>The end goal is the same as it's always been. Find a way to space.</p>

            <h1>EXPERIENCE</h1>
            <h3>How Do I Know What I'm Doing?</h3>
            <p>In the last few years, I've been doing the absolute best that I can to
            prepare myself for this future dream career of mine. In the classroom, I was
                involved in Indiana's 'Project Lead The Way' (PLTW) courses for 5 years,
            gaining skills in the principals of engineering and mechanical design; I was also
            a state finalist in the Indiana LEGO Robotics tournament a few years ago, before
            my runner-up finish in the 80/20 Engineering Challenge a few years later.<br><br>
            In the workforce, my technology experience runs a bit deeper. I am currently an
            IT Intern for the Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne / South Bend, and will soon begin
            another internship with a biomedical engineering company in Warsaw, Indiana.
            <br><br>Not to mention the year-long machine learning project mentioned above,
            and the fun things I do on the side to further my education! For me, the learning
            never stops!</p>
